                    <p>Community Resources 4 Youth, Inc., (collectively, “the organization”, "we," "us" or "our") is
                        committed to safeguarding your privacy. By using this website, including by providing us
                        with any personally identifiable information, you are accepting and consenting to the
                        practices described in this policy.</p>

                    <h2>1. Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
                    <p>a. Collection of Personal Information</p>
                    <p>Visiting the public areas of our website does not require you to provide any personally
                        identifiable information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, or Social
                        Security Number ("Personal Information"). The cookies used on the public areas of this website
                        do not gather Personal Information, although your computer's browser may automatically provide
                        us with certain other information, such as the date and time of your visit, your computer's
                        browser type, operating system and IP, and any referring and exiting URLs. You may choose,
                        however, to provide us Personal Information in order to contact us or to sign up for one of our
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>b. Legally Required Disclosure</p>
                    <p>We may disclose any information, including Personal Information, we deem necessary, in our sole
                        discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental
                        request.</p>
                    <p>c. Third Parties</p>
                    <p>Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent or transfer your
                    Personal Information to third parties without your consent. We may, however, use the information
                    you provide in aggregate form for internal purposes, such as generating statistics and
                    developing marketing plans. We may also collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally
                    identifiable information concerning use of the website, such as information regarding which of
                        our webpages are most visited.</p>
                    <p>We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                    include data analysis firms, web hosting companies, storage facilities, and parties that may
                    assist in our hiring process. Such third parties may be provided with access to Personal
                    Information needed to perform their functions for us, but may not use such information for any
                    other purpose. Such third parties may be located in countries that may not be subject to data
                    protection laws similar to those prevailing in the jurisdiction in which such Personal
                        Information is provided to or received by us.</p>
                    <p>However, we require these third parties to adhere to procedures that are at least as restrictive
                    as the procedures we follow ourselves with respect to your Personal Information, including this
                    Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p>d. Links</p>
                    <p>Our website may contain links to or from other websites. Please be aware that we are not
                    responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy
                    policies of other websites you link to from the Community Resources 4 Youth website or otherwise
                    visit. Third parties that have content embedded on our website such as a social feature may set
                    cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that a web browser visited
                    the Community Resources 4 Youth website from a certain IP address. Third parties cannot collect
                    any other personally identifiable information from our website unless you provide it to them
                        directly.</p>
                    <p>e. Retention or Correction of Personal Information</p>
                    <p>We retain Personal Information for as long as the information remains valid and as long as
                    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, maintain accurate records, resolve disputes, and
                    enforce our agreements. If you want us to remove or correct your Personal Information, please
                    contact us at info@cr4youth.org. We may decline to process requests that are
                    frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which
                        access is not otherwise required by local law.</p>
                    <p>f. Do Not Track</p>
                    <p>Community Resources 4 Youth does not track visitors to its website over time and across third
                    party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track
                        (DNT) signals.</p>
                    <h2>2. Data Sharing and Transfer</h2>
                    <p>Any information received by us through this website, including Personal Information, may be
                    transferred to or shared to members of the organization or third parties performing work on
                    behalf of the organization that may not be subject to data protections laws similar to those
                    prevailing in the jurisdiction in which such information is provided to or received by us.
                    However, all members of the organization or third parties who provide work on behalf of the
                    organization adhere to the same procedures with respect to your Personal Information, including
                        this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <h2>3. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes to our Privacy Policy,
                    we will post the revised policy here. The revised policy will also apply retroactively to all
                        data we have collected through the website.</p>
                    <h2>4. Comments</h2>
                    <p>If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our privacy policy or practices, please
